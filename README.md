Streamusâ„¢
=========

A Google Chrome extension which allows users to search & add songs to playlists, share playlists with others, and discover new songs.

Overview
========

Streamus consists of a front-end client, the Google Chrome extension, a back-end server and a website. This repository contains the files for the Google Chrome extension. Please see the other repositories, [StreamusServer](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusServer) and [StreamusWebsite](https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusWebsite), to gain a full understanding of the product.
Streamus currently only supports YouTube's API, but will be expanding to SoundCloud shortly.

Development
========

1. Navigate to: chrome://extensions/
2. Enabled developer mode by checking the 'Developer mode' checkbox. This will introduce several new buttons to the chrome://extensions page
3. Click the button 'Load unpacked extension...'
4. Select the directory '/Streamus Chrome Extension/src/'
5. Streamus is now loaded and ready for development.

**NOTE:**
Unless you're running an instance of the Streamus Server you will need to ensure that localDebug is set to **false**. This property can be configured by editing 'src/js/background/application.js'.
User login functionality may not work if the production Streamus Server is out of date, but all local functionality will continue to function.

Testing
------
Test cases may be ran by navigating to chrome-extension://jbnkffmindojffecdhbbmekbmkkfpmjd/test.html, but only after the extension package has been loaded into Google Chrome. 

Streamus uses [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [Chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) for its test cases.

Deployment
========

Streamus utilizes NodeJS and GruntJS to bundle and package itself for deployment to the Chrome Web Store.
Run "grunt deploy" to generate a new dist folder. Provide a version number, i.e. "grunt deploy:0.103" to generate a .zip file and adjust the build version. 
Uploading the .zip file to the Chrome Web Store will cause the new version to be distributed to all users within an hour.
